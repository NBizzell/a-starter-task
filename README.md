# A Starter Task for using GitHub in Education with Raspberry Pi

##Introduction

Interested in innovative ways to assess students work on Raspberry Pis in the classroom? Then github for education could provide a good answer. This tutorial will demonstrate how you could use github to give students some starter code to adapt, and how you can assess their changes.

##Step 1: Do you have a GitHub account?

Make sure that you have signed up for [GitHub here](https://github.com/). This [github cheat sheet may come in handy](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) too.

##Step 2: Make a copy of this *repository*

A repository is a type of folder on github. Making a copy of a respoistory is called **forking**. Click on the 'Fork' button at the top of the screen on the right hand side, and a copy of everything in this respoitory called **a-starter-task** will appear in your account.

##Step 3: Locate the code!

Now navigate back to your account and find the starter code called **code.py**. The code will look like this but will be in a text file:


##Step 4: Copy the code to your Raspberry Pi



##Step 5: Change the code


##Step 6: Upload the changed code to Github

The easiest way for you to do this without having to use the command line is to open the file on github by clicking on the **code.py** file in your forked repository. (Not our original!) Then click on **edit**. You can then paste your new code over the top. To save your code you need to **commit** it to the repository. You will notice that there is a comment box in which you can give a description to the code that you have changed. Add an explanantion here and then click on **Commit Changes**.

##Step 7: Share and Comment

Follow [Ben](http://github.com/bennuttall) or [Carrie Anne](http://github.com/missphilbin) and anyone else from Picademy. Then you will be able to see their forked repositories and their changed versions of code.py

You can comment on their work and give feedback by navigating to their forked respository and then clicking on the **issues** button on the right hand side of the screen. The icon looks like an exclamation mark in a circle. Then you can fill out a comment box and submit it.
